**作为一名前端开发工程师**

从第一次接触 HTML 开始，和前端开发，或者更贴却的说法是 Web 开发，打交道已经四年有余。当然我理解的前端不局限于网页，而是包括千万个终端，不管是手机、平板还是电脑，或者新兴的 VR、AR 等设备，它们与使用者直接产生交互，是机器与人交流的媒介。

如何能够设计以及开发出一套易用的交互程序，是一个简单而又十分复杂的工程，也是一个可以持续多年的探索项目。

Since I first came into contact with HTML, I have been dealing with front-end development, or more accurately, Web development, for more than four years. Of course, I think that the front-end is not limited to web pages, but includes millions of terminal devices, whether it is mobile phones, tablets or computers, or emerging VR, AR and other devices. They directly interact with users and are the medium of communication between machines and people.

How to design and develop an easy-to-use interactive program is a simple yet very complex project, and it is also an exploration project that can last for many years.
